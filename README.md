# The Cherry Blossom Hotel
### Abstract
In this project, I built a website designed to act as a hotel management tool for hotel customers and staff to manage room bookings and calculate customer bills. As a manager you are able to see a dashboard that contains the rooms available in the hotel, see todays revenue, and a visual representation of the occupancy. As a Customer, your dashboard shows all your past and future bookings, as well as how much you've spent with the hotel up to today. Of course with all hotel sites, you are given the option to book a room and view its' amenities for context.

### Goals and Objectives

-   Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
-   Work with an API to send and receive data
-   Solidify the code review process
-   Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

### See it in action 
- Clone down this repo
- Install NPM by running ``npm install ``
- Run ``npm start`` to see it run on a local host
- In your browser, place ``http://localhost:8080/``


## Deploying to GitHub Pages

_If you are finished with the functionality and testing of your project_, then you can consider deploying your project to the web! This way anyone can play it without cloning down your repo.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a great way to deploy your project to the web. Don't worry about this until your project is free of bugs and well tested!

If you _are_ done, you can follow [this procedure](./gh-pages-procedure.md) to get your project live on GitHub Pages.
