# The Cherry Blossom Hotel
### Abstract
In this project, I built a website designed to act as a hotel management tool for hotel customers and staff to manage room bookings and calculate customer bills. As a manager you are able to see a dashboard that contains the rooms available in the hotel, see todays revenue, and a visual representation of the occupancy. As a Customer, your dashboard shows all your past and future bookings, as well as how much you've spent with the hotel up to today. Of course with all hotel sites, you are given the option to book a room and view its' amenities for context.

### Goals and Objectives

-   Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
-   Work with an API to send and receive data
-   Solidify the code review process
-   Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application
